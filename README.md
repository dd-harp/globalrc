# Global Rc

Calculates malaria's control reproductive number (Rc) from malaria parasite prevalence (PfPR)
and treatment rates.

If we know the PfPR and some information on treatment rates, this converts
those numbers into an estimate of Rc. That estimate is one way to understand
transmission intensity in a region.

# Installation
