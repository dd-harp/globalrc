These are the two main data structures. Tiles and blocksizes are measured
in rows and columns, and they are stored as a numeric vector with names
"row" and "col". If you forget those, then you get NA. The same goes for
extents, which all have "rmin", "rmax", "cmin", "cmax" for the mininum and
maximum of rows and columns. We use these names to make it easier to
visually ascertain that rows are matched with rows and columns with columns.
