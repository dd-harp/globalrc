Description: Computes global Rc for malaria from PfPR and treatment rate.
    The inputs are two rasters, the malaria parasite rate in humans, PfPR,
    and a measure of treatment rate, AM for anti-malarials. This is a static
    conversion from those measures to a measure of transmission intensity
    in a region.
